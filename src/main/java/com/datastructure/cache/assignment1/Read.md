        I want to manage cache of all active users.
        make user history if he is active last 10 minutes  and must be part of cache.
        if user inactive more than 10 minutes then remove from cache.    
        if user login more than 3 times with in 10 minutes then block user for certain period of time.
        max user size is 5
